Hey Man, it's been a bit since I've left home and I know that you're probably missing me, so I put together a map for you to play. 
Maybe it will help you get a little better at the game and one day match my awesomeness.
First, however, I need to thank some people for helping playtest and give advice on the level.

Thank you to all these amazing people who helped and contributed to this map.
Good luck finding the strawberries.

Don't give up, man. You've got this. This level is a bit harder than the rest of the map, but I believe in you!
